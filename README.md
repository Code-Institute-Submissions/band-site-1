### Style
Research shows that the Monkees are a 1960's rock/pop band whose brand style is colourful and fun.<br>
Rainbow colouring based on the band's hit video Daydream Believer (featured on the site) has been used throughout the site styling to capture the essence of the Monkees' music and personal style.
This coloured theme is coupled with black and white imagery to reflect the band's retro style.

**Javascript** has been used to provide some minor animation and interaction for the site.
